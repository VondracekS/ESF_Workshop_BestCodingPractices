# Best Coding Practices Workshop
*held at the Faculty of Economics of the Masaryk University on 19.03.2023*

Please be informed I didn't solve some issues regarding the running of bash
scripts in this R Notebook. To complete the tasks, please run the Colab notebook
[here](https://github.com/VondracekS/ESF_Workshop_BestCodingPractices).

```{r, engine = 'bash'}
pwd
```


```{r, engine = 'bash'}
ls
```
```{r, engine = 'bash'}
cd data
ls
```
